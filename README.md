## Advanced Customization

### Overriding Color Settings

If you wish to tweak certain colors to better suit your workflow, you can override the default settings. Open your user `settings.json` and add your customizations under `workbench.colorCustomizations`:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
  "editor.background": "#000000",
  "editor.foreground": "#FFFFFF"
}




Adjusting Syntax Highlighting
To further personalize your coding experience, you can modify token colors in your settings.json by extending editor.tokenColorCustomizations:

"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
  "textMateRules": [
    {
      "scope": "comment",
      "settings": {
        "foreground": "#AAAAAA",
        "fontStyle": "italic"
      }
    }
  ]
}






Developer Tools for UI Inspection

For advanced troubleshooting or to understand how each color setting applies:
Open Developer Tools via Help > Toggle Developer Tools.
Use the inspector to see which UI elements are styled by which settings.
Make real-time adjustments in your settings.json before finalizing your changes.
